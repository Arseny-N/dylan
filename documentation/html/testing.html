<h1 id="testing">Testing</h1>
<p>This document describe various testing facilities offered by this project.
You can find them at <em>test-suite/</em> directory.</p>
<h2 id="server-testing">Server Testing</h2>
<p>Server testing is done by the means of a test runner called <strong>motcha</strong>, and 
a test collection called <strong>chai</strong>.</p>
<p>Mocha and chai use Node.js, so you have to install it on your computer to run them.</p>
<p>To run all the tests go to <em>test-suite/mocha-tester/</em> and run <strong>mocha</strong>. It will execute
the following test, using the JSON api offered by the web server :</p>
<ul>
<li>Write fixed valuers to registers and test weather the return value equals to &quot;success&quot;.</li>
<li>Read data form the registers and check weather it is correct (equal to the data previously written).</li>
<li>Write random data to random addresses of memory and check weather the return value is &quot;success&quot;.</li>
<li>Read data from memory and compare to the previously written.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ui-testing">UI Testing</h2>
<p>Well there are no ui tests, but there is a web server made to facilitate development.
Go to <em>test-suite/node-server</em> and run <code>node app</code>. You will get to web pages - one 
on <code>localhost:4000</code> and one on <code>localhost:4004</code>. The former is the development page - 
the server reads data form the <em>source</em> directory, so everything is not minimized.
The latter is the development page , the server reads data from the <em>build</em> directory, 
everything is minimized.</p>
<p>All register and memory i/o functionality is implemented.</p>
